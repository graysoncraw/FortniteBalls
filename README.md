# FortniteBalls

FortniteBalls is a fun little discord bot project that I started working on to improve my JS skills and learn how to make bots.

It will consist of 5 main functions using API's and a database:

<ul>
  <li>Daily Shop (✅)</li>
  <li>Player Stat Lookups (✅)</li>
  <li>Random Gif Generator (✅)</li>
  <li>Notification Setup For Specific Items (✅)</li>
</ul> 

Also uses djs-commander and discord-js packages.

The bot is hosted and coded in Replit, a terrific online IDE.
